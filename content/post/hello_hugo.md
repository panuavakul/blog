# Hello Hugo

Maybe, it's about time that I stop being lazy and start blogging again. I've been blogging without much success in the past, but hopefully it would be better this time. Hugo seems easy enough for blogging, that I can just create markdown files and it can generate the sites for me. The only thing that worries me is that's quite a pain to add photos to the post unlike the actual blogging services liek Medium that you can just drag and drop the image in. Maybe, I can play with [netlify-cms](https://www.netlifycms.org/) or [forestry](https://forestry.io) later. Btw, have to thank [Xzya](https://github.com/Xzya/hugo-bootstrap) for the great Hugo's theme.

I'll try to blog about my adventure with Flutter and other developements I might be involved with in the future. And since I tends to waste a lot of my cash on weird electronics, hopefully I can review those here too.
